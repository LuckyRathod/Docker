## To check WSL Version 

CMD > wsl -l -v 

## IF WSL Version - 1 , Install wsl2 or update Ubuntu and Docker Desktop

## To check Docker Version

CMD > docker --version

## Docker Basic Commands 

1. Start Container using image

> docker run name_of_image (It create a new container everytime. Container will be created with image pulled or found locally)

Example : docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
Example : docker run nginx

2. List Container 

> docker ps (It will only show running containers)
> docker ps -a (It will show all exited and running containers)

3. Start a Container 

> docker start name1_of_containers (Attach Mode - Name can be found in "Names" column of "docker ps")

3.A  Run Specific already created Container - But in interactive mode

> docker start -i 9835047230a2 (Attach interacitve mode)

3. Stop a Container 

> docker stop name_of_container (Name can be found in "Names" column of "docker ps")

Example : docker stop serene_diffie

4. Delete a Container 

## Before deleting make sure that container is in STOP Mode

> docker rm serene_diffie (Container will be deleted and it will also not get shown in "docker ps -a")

5. List Images 

> docker images

6. Delete Image 

> docker rmi repository_name_of_image_available (Images available from "docker images")

Example : docker rmi docker/getting-started

7. Pull an image 

## When you run "doker run nginx" - It will first search locally . If not found then it will pull an image online - Docker HUB

>docker run nginx (It will create the container and run for you.)


8. Only pull an image , But dont run it in container 

>docker pull nginx

9. Ubuntu Container 

> docker run ubuntu (It will get download , And then it will get exited - Check using "docker ps -a")

## Docker is not supposed to host OS . It is only meant to run process 

## Start the ubuntu container and run command "sleep 5"

> docker run ubuntu sleep 5 (You will be able to see "sleep 5" in command column of "docker ps -a")

10. If you want to know more about whats happening in backgrounf of "sleep 5"

## Run the container > docker run ubuntu sleep 120 

## Make sure in Docker Desktop - Settings - Resources - WSL integration - Enable integration with addition WSL distro - ubuntu 20.0.4 

## Open WSL Ubuntu and RUN Ubuntu commands . Ubuntu commands will only get execute when Container is running . If it is not running then you wont be able to run commands

## If WSL is integrated - You can directly run this from Ubuntu 

~$docker ps

~$docker exec 86b39414ae82 cat /etc/hosts

~$docker exec 86b39414ae82 cat /etc/*release*

## If you are opening from Docker Desktop - CLI . Then you dont neet to write "docker exec 86b39414ae82" .

# /bin/bash
# cat /etc/hosts
# cat /etc/*release*

11. Two Modes of running container

- Attach Mode (Your CMD will be running container . You wont be able to run other docker commands in same cmd)
> docker run ubuntu sleep 120

## If you already have container ID 

> docker start 7de5a50d955f
> docker attach 7de5a50d955f (You wont be able to run any other commands)



- Dettach Mode (Container will be running in background . You can run other commands)
> docker run -d ubuntu sleep 120

## So once you work in dettach mode . You can directly run Ubuntu Commands on the same cmd 

## So complete Flow will look like 

> docker run -d ubuntu sleep 120
> docker ps (You will get container ID for above cmd)
> docker exec 3b2d84d97f87 cat /etc/hosts

12. Running Commands Inside Container

## Running cmds directly in bash -- it : interactive (So even if you are running container in attach mode .You will get interactive input window . It gives you pseudo terminal)

> docer run -it ubuntu bash 
# cat /etc/hosts (You can run Linux commands directly in same cmd)

## Exiting above interactive container 

# exit 

### DOCKER RUN --- FEATURES AND IMP COMMANDS 

13. Using TAGS 

Search Docker Alpine in Google to get different Tags 

> docker run alpine (By Default alpine with "latest" tag is run)

### Run Specific version of image

>docker run alpine:3.12.8

14. Standard Input 

## If your image contains any standard input request . Then you should run the container in Interactive mode 

> docker run -i image_name 

OR

> docker run -it image_name 

15. PORT Mapping 

## If your app in container is running on IP Address - 172.17.0.2:5000. It is not accessible to outside world . Unless and untill it is mapped 

> docker run -p 8080:5000 image_name

16. VOLUME Mapping

## Let assume we have mysql container - It stores data in /var/lib/mysql
## Now If incase you stop the container or Remove the container . It means that your data stored in /var/lib/mysql will also get deleted.
## So for that type of problem . We can create Persistent storage in ubuntu where we will dump our data from above path to the ubuntu path

~$ pwd (o/p - /home/lucky)
~$ mkdir data
~$ cd data

~$ docker run mysql

## Running container with volume mapping 

## All data from /var/lib/mysql will get saved in /home/lucky/data

~/data$ docker run -v /home/lucky/data:/var/lib/mysql mysql

17. Docker RUN - Inspect -- Gives complete information about container

> docker inspect 9835047230a2

18. Docker RUN - Logs

> docker logs 9835047230a2

19. Docker Image (DockerFile) - Refer Docker File Sample

## It is a layered architecture - Every step acts as a different layer.
## Caching mechanism is also used in eah steps/layer

## Every Docker File consist of Two Things - Instructions , Arguments 
## IMP Instructions in Docker File 

- FROM 
- RUN 
- WORKDIR
- COPY
- ENTRYPOINT

20. Docker Build 

## It starts executing the layers/steps mentioned in Dockfile.

> docker build Dockerfile -t name_of_your_choice_for_container

21. Docker Push 

> docker push name_of_your_choice_for_container

22. Creating Custom Image - Basic Sample -- Refer Basic_Sample/app.py

## Before creating DockerFile . We will manually do all steps by creating container 

## Open cmd - Project which is to be containerized

> cd path_to_project
> docker run -p 8000:5000 -it ubuntu bash

# apt-get update
# apt-get install -y python3
# apt-get install -y python3-pip
# pip3 install flask

## Copy your simple flask app.py code

# cd /opt/
# apt-get install nano
# nano app.py (Create a file) - Paste code - ctrl + 0 , Enter , ctrl + X , Filename 
# python3 app.py (ctrl + c - install curl)
# apt-get install curl

## Open another CLI from Docker Desktop w.r.t container 

# curl --location --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/'
# curl --location --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/container'


# history (It will help you to get all commands run by you)

23. Creating Custom Image - Flask App

## Create Docker File 

> cd path_where_docker_file_is

## Docker Login 

>docker login 


> docker build . -t docker_login_username/salpred

## Image will be created 

>docker images

>docker run -p 8080:5000 docker_login_username/salpred (Check whether your application is running)

>docker push docker_login_username/salpred

24. Using Env variables

> docker build . -t username/imagename

> docker run -e MY_USER=lucky -e MY_PASS=123 username/imagename

OR 

> docker run --env-file .env username/imagename
